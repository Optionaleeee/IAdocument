    <h1>DHS IA Notice</h1>
    <p>I want to take a moment to talk about something important — activity. We’ve come a long way, and I appreciate the time and effort many of you have already put in. That said, we need to step things up as a group to keep things alive, active, and enjoyable for everyone.</p>
    <p>Starting now, 1 hour of patrol per week will be strictly enforced. This is a minimal commitment that helps keep the community running smoothly and ensures we’re all doing our part.</p>
    <p>I understand we all have different schedules, but consistency is key to keeping this community active and thriving. If you’re having any issues that might prevent you from meeting this requirement, please reach out to staff ahead of time so we can work with you.</p>
    <p>Let’s stay sharp and keep the momentum going. Thanks for your dedication.</p>

    <h1>Internal Oversight</h1>
    <p>In addition to the updated patrol requirements, I want to make everyone aware that Internal Affairs is currently conducting oversight focused on the Department of Homeland Security's command structure, specifically targeting high-ranking personnel within the agency. This initiative is part of a broader administrative review intended to ensure leadership accountability, operational readiness, and consistent engagement within critical roleplay divisions—particularly those tasked with high-level security functions.</p>
    <p>The objective is not punitive, but rather to uphold standards of leadership and set clear expectations for activity, presence, and contribution to overall departmental operations. High command roles, especially within a specialized agency like DHS, carry the obligation of visibility, coordination, and enforcement of protocol—expectations that must be actively demonstrated.</p>
    <p>Personnel found to be consistently inactive or failing to meet leadership standards may be subject to administrative action, including but not limited to demotion or reassignment. Those currently holding command positions are strongly encouraged to review their schedules and ensure compliance with both activity mandates and leadership responsibilities.</p>
    <p>We appreciate everyone’s cooperation as Internal Affairs continues this effort.</p>

    <h1>IA Clarification Notice</h1>
    <p>We want to address a matter that’s recently come up to ensure clarity and protect the integrity of our agency.</p>
    <p><strong>IA important notice:</strong> Leo_b0ll is not affiliated with our agency in any capacity. He has not held a position or been involved in operations for an extended period, and any actions, comments, or claims made by him do not represent us in any way.</p>
    <p>Additionally, we’re aware of ongoing rumors circulating that attempt to tie our agency to statements or behavior that are entirely false. Let us be clear: these rumors are baseless and do not reflect the reality of how we operate.</p>
    <p>We ask all members to refrain from spreading unverified claims, and to direct any questions or concerns to Command Staff. Our focus remains on professionalism, community engagement, and maintaining the standards we've worked hard to build.</p>
    <p>Thank you for your continued dedication and understanding.</p>

    <h1>⚠️ On-Duty Conduct Reminder</h1>
    <p>This is a reminder to all personnel: inappropriate behavior while on duty will not be tolerated under any circumstances.</p>
    <p>Whether you're on patrol, engaging with the public, or operating within a division, you are representing this agency — and your actions reflect on all of us. Unprofessional conduct, trolling, or behavior that breaks character or department protocol will result in disciplinary action if observed or reported.</p>
    <p>This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Disruptive or unserious roleplay</li>
      <li>Harassment or disrespect toward other members</li>
      <li>Abusing tools, commands, or authority</li>
      <li>Breaking chain of command or violating uniform/vehicle policies</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you’re caught, you will face consequences — up to and including suspension or removal. We’re here to create a realistic, respectful, and enjoyable environment for all members and the community we serve.</p>
    <p>Let’s hold ourselves to the standards this department stands for.</p>
